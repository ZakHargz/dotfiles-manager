# Golang Template Project

## About the project

This is a simple app that can help manage your dotfiles. You have the option whether you want to install the dotfiles
from the data directory (in this repo) and they'll be copied into the relevant areas (listed in data/data.json), or you can
update from your local area into this git repo ready to be committed.

Please fork and clone this repo to use.
